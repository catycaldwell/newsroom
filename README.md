# SmartBrief
Seattle Expedition Hackathon - Team Newsroom (Best Presentation, 3rd Place overall)

***SmartBrief*** is a daily, intelligent news curation application that was founded in 2017. It uses deep learning methods to automate the curation of news stories, along with short summaries for public officials.

These news digests are referred to as briefs. The briefs contain links to the source that curators can navigate to read more about a story or topic if they wish. SmartBrief also helps facilitate dialogues between curators and briefers to review and curate briefs in a simulated briefing room.
